        In this chapter, you’ll find detailed descriptions of the perks and flaws that you can use to round out your character’s personality, background, strengths, and weaknesses. Additionally, you’ll learn how to activate your perks and flaws to enhance your roleplaying and gain mechanical benefits.

    <string name="subTitle1_ch5">
        Fleshing Out Your Character with Perks and Flaws
    </string>
    
    <string name="paragraph2_ch5">
        <b>Perks</b> are characteristics that describe very specific skills, attitudes, backgrounds, or opportunities that tend to give your character the upper hand in certain situations. For example, maybe you are a noble and thus able to draw favors from powerful political figures, or perhaps you once served as mechanic on a starship and those technical skills still help you out in your adventuring life today.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph3_ch5">
        <b>Flaws</b> are your Achilles’ heel. They are weaknesses that your enemies can exploit or character deficits that always seem to hold you back at just the wrong moment. Maybe you are stubborn as a mule and won’t accept a compromise under any circumstances. Perhaps your greed tends to get the best of you, and your love of coin will even trump your loyalty to your friends. Your flaws might even be physical in nature: you’re blind, missing an arm, or suffer from a wounded knee that slows you down.
    </string>
    
    <string name="subTitle1_section1_ch5">
        <b>Acquiring Perks and Flaws</b>
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph4_ch5">
        At character creation, you may select up to two perks and two flaws, and you do not have to select any. Throughout your adventures, the GM may assign you additional perks and flaws as the natural results of your deeds. For example, if your party spends several months on board a ship, the GM may reward everyone with the <i>profession: sailor</i> perk. Likewise, if you are subjected to horrible chemical burns as part of a laboratory explosion, the GM might assign you the <i>physical deformity</i> flaw to describe your scarred face.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph5_ch5">
        You too, may decide to adopt new perks or flaws with the GM’s approval as your character’s personality and background develop through play. Perhaps a series of encounters with powerful forces leads you to take on the <i>cowardly</i> flaw. Or maybe you spend significant downtime between adventures training with the local weaponsmith and would like to gain the <i>artisan</i> perk. The GM is the final arbiter for deciding when and under what circumstances you may choose new perks and flaws, but you should communicate with them your hopes for your character’s development.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle1_section2_ch5">
        <b>Designing Your Own Perks and Flaws</b>
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph6_ch5">
        The lists provided in this chapter are by no means comprehensive, and you are encouraged to work with your GM to create the perks and flaws that you need to define your character.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph7_ch5">
        Flaws are very easy to create, as they simply represent situational triggers that hold your character back. Because the PCs decides when their flaws take effect, there is no need to consider balance when creating new flaws.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph8_ch5">
        Perks, on the other hand, often grant elaborate benefits and even mechanical bonuses. These require you to work closely with your GM to ensure that your perks are balanced with the other perks available to PCs. The first rule to adhere to is that perks should provide non-combat effects, as feats, banes, and boons are the primary means for PCs to boost their combat expertise. Next, try to make your proposed perk limited to a specific type of task or a relatively rare situation. For example, the <i>artisan</i> perk provides expertise for a single craft, and the <i>attractive</i> perk is only beneficial in social situations that rely on physical attractiveness. If your perk is more generally applicable, then the effect should be more limited than other perks. For example, the <i>idol</i> perk makes you trusted by just about anyone, but it is limited to being used once per game session.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle2_ch5">
        <b>Activating Perks</b>
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph9_ch5">
        Perks provide very specific bonuses or effects in specific situations. Your perk description will explain exactly what your perk does and how often it can be activated. Some perks can be used whenever the situation merits while others are more limited. If the use of a perk relies on a situation being relevant to the sphere of influence of the perk, the GM has the final say as to whether the perk applies or not. For example, the <i>profession</i> perk provides advantage 1 to any non-combat action rolls related to your chosen profession. If a character wants to use their <i>profession: hunter</i> perk to gain advantage on a roll to track an orc, the GM would decide whether or not the PC’s experience tracking game was relevant enough to aid in the hunt for a humanoid.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle3_ch5">
        <b>Activating Flaws</b>
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph10_ch5">
        While perks provide specific benefits according to their descriptions, flaws are actively used by players to hinder the actions of their characters. You would do this for two primary reasons: first, to add depth and variety to your character and the story; and, second, to earn legend points, which can be used to enhance your chances of success on a future action (see Chapter 2: Actions and Attributes). In this way, flaws and legend points provide a sort of karmic balance to one another. Your sacrifice in one situation is rewarded in a future situation.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph11_ch5">
        To activate a flaw, you should intentionally make a disadvantageous choice based on your flaw that creates an interesting or tense moment in the plot. When you do so, let your GM know that you are activating your flaw and describe how it is hindering your efforts or influencing your decisions. If the GM approves that your flaw is creating a significant disadvantage and advancing the story, you receive one legend point. Sometimes, the GM may recognize that you are roleplaying a flaw without you having to overtly activate it. In such cases, the GM may award you with a legend point as well.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph12_ch5">
        You may not gain a legend point from the same flaw more than once per game session. Furthermore, you are in complete control of how and when your own flaws affect you. For example, you might play a blind samurai (using the <i>disabled</i> flaw) who has such heightened senses of hearing, smell, and touch that they’re usually completely unaffected by their blindness. Only under extreme circumstances does the blindness hinder them.
    </string>

    <string name="paragraph13_ch5">
        The type of hindrance caused by activating a flaw should be more than a simple reduced chance of success. Good examples of activating a flaw include putting yourself or an ally in danger, making a bad decision, wasting a resource, and missing out on an opportunity, among others. It’s also important to note that a good use of a flaw makes something new and interesting happen in the story rather than ending the narrative. For example, instead of activating a flaw to miss an attack, you might target an ally. Or, rather than activating a flaw to fail to find a secret door, you might make so much noise in your search that you attract unwanted attention.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle3_section1_ch5">
        <b>Examples of Activating Flaws</b>
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle3_p1_ch5">
        1. Oxnar the Barbarian was never known for his brains, so when the pixie promised him that eating the golden mushroom would make him as strong as a hundred mules, he gobbled it up with no questions and much gusto. A minute later he was dozing in a puddle of his own drool as the imp made off with his coin purse. The GM awards Oxnar with a legend point for effectively roleplaying his <i>dimwitted</i> flaw to his own detriment.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle3_p2_ch5">
        2. Normally, Celeste’s blindness from the <i>disabled</i> flaw doesn’t stop her from being one of the best shots in the Badlands. Her keen hearing and extrasensory perception more than make up for her lack of sight. The unearthly wailing of these zombie shriekers, however, have overwhelmed her senses. The player who is role-playing Celeste decides that the situation is dicey enough that she will unintentionally target one of her allies. She lets the GM know that she is specifically activating her <i>disabled</i> flaw, and the GM agrees that the impact is significant enough to merit a legend point for adding a new level of depth and realism to the story the group is telling together.
    </string>

    <string name="subTitle3_p3_ch5">
        3. The psion Madrina has the <i>ambitious</i> flaw. After rescuing a group of mining colony civilians from a catastrophic air lock breach, Madrina is given the chance to ask a reward of the Chancellor. Madrina asks for the hand of the Chancellor’s eldest in marriage, rather than a more reasonable request such as a pick from the Chancellor’s treasury. The Chancellor becomes infuriated, but the GM awards a legend point for role-playing a flaw in a way that advances the story.

            Whether you are an android constructed of space age material that does not erode over time, the loyal servant of a higher power, or the subject of an arcane ritual, you have unlocked the secret to immortality. You are immune to the passage of time and the effects of old age. Your body does not age and you cannot be harmed by extraordinary effects that cause aging. Based on the source of your agelessness, you can decide whether or not your appearance changes over time.

In a time frame decided by the GM, you can craft any mundane item of wealth level 2 or less, if you have access to the right tools. Furthermore, whenever you are performing a task in which your crafting skills would play a role, you gain advantage 1 to any action rolls that you must make. Your reputation means that other students of your craft may actively seek you out as a teacher. Experts in any field that makes use of the items you create will actively recommend that others seek you out. “You want the best overclocked CPU for that supercomputer? You need to talk to Razul, he’s the best hardware craftsman this side of the Third Sun.”

            You are well-versed in the art of living with less. Whether a cloistered monk, a transcendent psion, or a wizened sage who spent years locked away in a tower of books, you are experienced at going long stretches of time with very little food, water, or company - and as such, these situations tend not to affect you as they do others.

        </string>
        <string name="earOfTheEmperor_description">
            You have done something in the past to earn the favor of someone in a high place: a senator, the general of an army, a merchant lord, etc. Perhaps you saved their life or spared them from significant monetary loss. Whatever you did, they owe you, and they are willing to help you with minor favors as long as the favors do not subject them to any risk or cost. Once during the campaign, you can call in a large favor that does put your contact in risk or cost them something significant. They will perform the favor, but you immediately lose this trait, as their debt has been repaid.

As such, a sense of awe follows you when met by those who know and respect your heritage. Choose an area of expertise, such as arcana, politics, or warfare. You are assumed to have knowledge and a destiny for greatness in the chosen area of expertise, and others treat you with deference.

        </string>
        <string name="naturesAlly_description">
            The natural world responds to your deep connection with it. Perhaps you are a preservationist, seeking to restore organic life in a shattered post-apocalyptic wasteland, or maybe you are a hermit closely attuned to the animals and plants of the Sylvan woodlands. Whatever your circumstance, people and creatures connected to the land can sense your deep respect for the natural order.

        <string name="observant_description">
            Your keen senses allow you to notice details that others typically miss. Once per game session, you can use this ability to notice something out of the ordinary. For example, you might spot a hidden passage behind a bookcase, a trace of blood under the fingernails of another character, or a wig that is not quite convincing.

        </string>
        <string name="pureHearted_description">

            You have lived a life of need, and thus know how to make do when others would go without. Once per game session, you can easily acquire a single mundane item even though it would otherwise take time to get or be completely unattainable. Depending on the circumstances, the GM may decide that your acquisition is only temporary or subject to reasonable conditions. For example, you might use this perk to acquire a rope in the middle of a desert, but the GM may rule that it is so sunbaked and ancient that it will likely snap after a few uses.
        </string>
    
        <string name="scent_perk">

As one of the invisible urchins that crawl the city, you are also quite adept at picking up rumors in taverns and crowded streets. You gain advantage 1 on rolls for situations in which your street rat nature would be helpful.

            <b>Upper Class</b>
        </string>
        <string name="upperClass_description">
            Being of high birth, old money, or otherwise given access to resources beyond the common citizen, you are treated as a benefactor by the lower classes. They will trust and help you in the hopes of being rewarded for their efforts. You are also treated as a peer by those of similar or slightly higher social standing and can typically request an audience with them. In addition, representatives of the law generally assume you to be beyond reproach unless they are presented with compelling evidence to the contrary.

        <string name="vagabond_description">
            Having spent significant time fending for yourself in the wilderness, you excel at surviving and navigating in the wild.

            <b>Warrior\'s Code</b>
        </string>
        <string name="warriorsCode_description">
            As a veteran warrior, you command respect even from foes. Once per session, you can use this perk to cause an enemy or group of enemies to extend special concessions or favorable treatment toward you via an unspoken warrior’s code. The GM decides what these concessions look like. For example, your enemies might choose to trust you to come quietly and not shackle you, or overlook an insult that would have otherwise have been cause for bloodshed.

        </string>
        <string name="wildWhisperer_description">
            Once per game session, you can ask a single “yes” or “no” question of a plant or animal within earshot. The plant or animal automatically trusts you at least enough to answer the question truthfully. You receive the answer by way of an inner sense, and so this ability cannot be used for further two-way communication.

        </string>
        <string name="absentMinded_description">
            You live with your head in the clouds. You might just be ditzy, or maybe you just spend your time contemplating loftier matters. Whatever the source of your absent-mindedness, you are slow to notice important details and have a tendency to get distracted at exactly the worst possible moment.
        </string>

        <string name="addiction_flaw">
            <b>Addiction</b>
        </string>
        <string name="addiction_description">
            The roll of the dice, the smoke of the Black Lotus, or the escape of the virtual reality machine. Whether your addiction is physical, mental, or social, the effect is generally the same: you’ve got an itch that you need to scratch, and you’ll sometimes do reckless or atrocious things to make sure that you can get your fix. You get to decide the nature and severity of your addiction.

        <string name="ambitious_flaw">
            <b>Ambitious</b>
        </string>
        <string name="ambitious_description">
            You are willing to do anything to get ahead in life and often that means trampling upon other people on your way to the top. When presented with a situation requiring empathy for those beneath you, it’s typical for you to ignore their need. In addition, you may sometimes overreach in your attempts to get ahead, making bold and risky choices that can put you and those close to you in danger.
        </string>

        <string name="bloodlust_flaw">
            <b>Bloodlust</b>
        </string>
        <string name="bloodlust_description">
            Battle isn’t just a way of life, it is <i>the way</i> of life. There isn’t a conflict you’ve encountered that wasn’t best solved with steel or lead, and your allies will have a hard time convincing you otherwise. You are prone to starting fights when they aren’t necessary and prolonging them even after the enemy has surrendered.
        </string>

        <string name="brash_flaw">
            <b>Brash</b>
        </string>
        <string name="brash_description">
            You are bold and daring to the point of recklessness. You have no time for plans, calculations, or strategic thinking. A lot of brass and a bit of luck are all you need. Kick in the door and let the details sort themselves out.

        </string>
        <string name="bravado_description">
            You have a flair for the dramatic, and will often undertake bold or daring maneuvers simply for the thrill of it. For example, in combat you might swing from a chandelier even if it offers no tactical advantage.

            <b>Cosmetic Deformity</b>
        </string>
        <string name="cosmeticDeformity_description">
            Something about you makes you less attractive, undesirable to behold, or even just downright abominable. You get to decide the nature and severity of your deformity. Examples include a scarred cheek, vacant white eyes, a burn-covered body, and a missing nose. Whatever form this flaw takes, it is merely cosmetic and thus will generally only affect you in social situations.

            <b>Compulsion</b>

            You have an irresistible urge to perform a behavior of your choice. Examples include, grinding your teeth, tapping your foot, biting your fingernails, counting coinage, and washing your hands. Your compulsion can sometimes put you in awkward or embarrassing situations, such as needing to wash your hands immediately after shaking hands with an ambassador.

            <b>Cowardly</b>
        </string>
        <string name="cowardly_description">
            You have honed self-preservation into a way of life, and you will do almost anything to avoid danger, pain, and death. Sometimes, the situation at hand and the pumping of adrenaline will lead you to perform acts that appear courageous, but sooner or later your cowardly nature will emerge. You are easy to intimidate and you will almost assuredly crack under interrogation. In combat, you can still choose to fight, but you will attempt to distance yourself as much as possible from harm’s way, even if it means leaving an ally in a tough spot.

            <b>Dimwitted</b>
        </string>
        <string name="dimwitted_description">
            You aren’t the sharpest tack in the box. It’s not just that you weren’t gifted with skill in academia, it’s that you pick up on things pretty slowly overall. With the exception of your areas of expertise, you have a hard time learning new skills, following instructions, and maybe even remembering names.

        <string name="greedy_flaw">
            <b>Greedy</b>
        </string>
        <string name="greedy_description">
            You can’t help it: you just like <i>things</i>. Money, gems, items of power - they beckon you at every turn and you’ll often take great risks and maybe even betray your allies if the monetary reward is great enough. You’re easy to bribe, and you will often push the limits of negotiation or bartering in order to increase your share in the profits, even if it makes you a few enemies.

            <b>Honest</b>

        <string name="hotTempered_description">

        </string>
        <string name="literalMinded_description">
            You struggle with concepts and turns of phrase that are not literally true, such as idioms and metaphors. You might think sorcery is afoot if someone tells you it is “raining cats and dogs”. If a friend exaggerates by saying “I’d kill myself if Melzak were elected Supreme Justice”, you would be genuinely concerned for your friend’s life if Melzak did get elected.

        <string name="naive_flaw">

        </string>
        <string name="naive_description">
            Whether you are innocent, uninformed, or inexperienced, the results are the same: you are pretty gullible. You get to define the scope of your naivety. For example, maybe you’re a greenhorn from a big city on the east coast, so you are unlearned in the ways of the Wild West. Or maybe your memory was completely wiped out a few weeks ago and you are relearning the rules of civilization, thus your naivety presents itself much more universally.

            <b>Overt</b>
        </string>
        <string name="overt_description">
            You have a strong aversion to subterfuge, legerdemain, and smooth talking. After all, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, so why not follow the straight and narrow path? Your overtness may lead to you mistakenly foil the plans of allies, such as by blurting out a sensitive truth in the midst of a tense negotiation.

            You disdain combat and bloodshed of any kind, and will generally do whatever possible to avoid it. You can decide the extent of your pacifism.

        <string name="phobia_flaw">
            <b>Phobia</b>
        </string>
        <string name="phobia_description">
            You are terrified and incapable of rational thought when you are presented with the object of your fear. It could be spiders, snakes, closed spaces, crowds, or something less common like co-dependence: a fear of being alone that causes you to always seek out companionship, even if that companionship has a negative impact on your life overall.

        </string>
        <string name="proud_description">
            Some call it an inflated ego. Others call it conceit. But you know that you really are just that good. The rabble are inferior, and you’re not afraid to let them know. Your pride may be a universal sense of self-worth, or it may only manifest itself within certain spheres or situations. For example, your rank in the Royal Star Force leads you to look down upon anyone trained in less illustrious armed forces.

            You are severely mentally deranged to the extent that you occasionally lose touch with reality.

        <string name="sociallyAwkward_description">
            Something about your behavior tends to rub people the wrong way. Perhaps you don’t respect the personal space of others, tend to ramble in conversation, or share overly personal details. Whatever the nature of your awkwardness, it makes social situations difficult for you at times.

            You stand for a cause—whether it is a religion, a nation, a code, a way of life, or otherwise—and you will push the boundaries of normal behavior to uphold your cause. This might mean that you make yourself a social outcast by attempting to convert others to your cause, or it could mean that you are willing to perform an act you might otherwise consider evil, such as putting innocent lives in danger, if doing so would promote your cause.
